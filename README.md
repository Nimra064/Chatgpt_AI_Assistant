# Chatgpt_AI_Assistant
To create a Gradio application similar to ChatGPT, we leverage the power of the ChatGPT API provided by OpenAI.Gradio's graphical user interface (GUI) is a Python library that allows us to create customizable interfaces for machine learning models. We can define the input and output components of the application, such as text input boxes and chat-like response displays, using Gradio. <br>

# Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a Gradio application similar to ChatGPT: <br>
###  Step 1: Design the Framework Using Gradio GUI:

1. Install the Gradio library in your Python environment.<br>
2. Import the necessary modules, including gradio, to your project.<br>
3. Use the Gradio GUI to define the input and output components of your application. For example, you can create a text input box for users to enter their queries and a chat-like response display to show the generated responses.<br>
4.Customize the appearance and functionality of your application by setting attributes such as labels, placeholder texts, and button styles.<br>

### Step 2: Create an API on OpenAI and Obtain the Key:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account link here https://platform.openai.com/ and create an API key. <br>
2. Follow OpenAI's documentation to create a up  API key and ensure it is valid for accessing the ChatGPT API. <br>
3. Take note of your API key, as you'll need it in the next step. <br>

### Step 3: Import the API and Define Functions for User Input and Output

1. Import the necessary modules, including openai, to your project. <br>
2. Use the OpenAI API key to authenticate your requests. <br>
3. Define a function that takes user input as text and sends it to the ChatGPT API using the <b>openai.Completion.create()</b> method.<br>
4. Extract the generated response from the API's response and return it as the output of your function.<br>

### Step 4: Use Hugging Face for Application Deployment

1. Access the Hugging Face website through this link https://huggingface.co/ <br>
2.Sign up for a Hugging Face account and create a space for your application.<br>
3. Use the Hugging Face CLI or the web interface to upload your application files and dependencies to your space.<br>
4. Deploy your Gradio application using the Hugging Face deployment features, which will provide a public URL for your application.<br>
5. Test your deployed application and make sure it behaves as intended.<br>
6. Public URL for your application here you can access through this Link https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nimra064/gradio_chatgpt_chatbox <br>
7. My Application Framework Display look like this : <br>

### Conclusion : <br>
By following these steps, you can design, develop, and deploy a Gradio application similar to ChatGPT, leveraging the power of the OpenAI API and the Hugging Face platform.<br>
